<!-- This is a comment and will not show up in your document. Note that the

# Lab Tutorial

## Getting Started: What is R?
In Statistics, we often use computers to analyze data. There are a lot of programs that can help you do statistical analyses. One of the most popular (and powerful) is called R. R is a "statistical computing environment" that is designed for manipulating data, doing calculations, and making graphical displays. R works by writing **R code**.

That might sound scary, but *don't worry*: this is not a programming class. Over the course of the semester, you'll learn how to edit and write some basic R code to help you analyze data to answer research questions. Our goal in lab is to help you learn the basics of R and R coding, but through the lens of answering statistical questions.

### What are all these "R" terms?
There are a lot of "R" words floating around. What's going on?

- *R* is a "statistical computing environment" that's designed for manipulating data, generating plots, and performing analyses. It's also a programming language. You'll be *using R* this semester.
- *R Studio* is an "integrated development environment (IDE)" for R (you'll never have to hear the term IDE again in this class). Basically, it's a pretty interface that makes working with R easier. You use R inside of R Studio. If R is ice cream, R Studio is the cone or cup.
- *R Markdown* is a way to write pretty analysis reports that combines R code, R output (plots, analysis results, etc.) and text in one document. This lab document is an R Markdown report!

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. R Markdown lets you combine text, R code, and plots in one pretty, reproducible report. If you're curious about this, you can find more details on using R Markdown at <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

R Markdown runs code contained in "chunks". A chunk looks like this:
```{r helloWorld} 
print("Hello world!")
```

Notice that the code, `print("Hello world!")` is contained between three backticks (```, right below the esc key on a US English keyboard) -- this is how R Markdown knows where your chunks start and stop. You can just run a single chunk by clicking the green "play" button in the upper right corner of the chunk.

When you click the **Knit** button in R Studio, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

### Tips for R Markdown
1. **Knit and knit often**: Frequently knitting your document will help you make sure that all your code works and that the document looks the way you want.
1. **Don't be afraid to experiment**: Nobody gets things exactly right the first time, and we all forget how things work sometimes. Keep trying, and you'll eventually get what you want!
1. **Formatting**: You can make text **bold** by surrounding it with two asterisks (`**`) and *italic* by surrounding it with one asterisk (`*`).

## Using R as a Calculator
At it's most basic, R is a fancy calculator. 

TODO: RUN ALL CHUNKS ABOVE
Remember, you can run the code in this chunk by clicking the green "play" button in the upper right corner of the chunk. 
```{r calculatorExample}
5 * 7
```
When you run the chunk, you'll see a `[1]` before the output of `35`. *Just ignore this. The result is `35`.*

All of the symbols you think you'd use to do math work: + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division, ^ for exponentiation.

**Try it yourself!**
In the chunk below, compute 50 divided by 9. You'll notice the chunk contains the text `# Write code here!`. This is called a "comment" -- it's not code that R runs, it's just there to explain your code. Feel free to delete and replace it, or start a new line and type there. See what happens!
```{r tryItCalculator, error = T}
# Write code here! This text is a comment, so it's not run by R. Replace it with code to compute 50 divided by 9.

```

## R Function Syntax
We'll be using R primarily through the use of *functions*. A function generally looks something like this: 

```{r genericFunction, eval = F}
function.name(argument1, argument2, ...)
```

Notice that we have the name of the function, followed immediately by an open parenthesis `(` without a space, then a sequence of *arguments* to the function, separated by commas `,`. 

## R "Assignment" Syntax

Often, we want R to remember the results of a calculation so that we can use it later. We can give the result of some code a name by **assigning** it to something.

```{r assignmentDemo}
x <- 36 / 6
```

We read that code as "x *gets* 36 / 6". The arrow is made using the less-than symbol (`<`, shift + comma on a US English keyboard) and a hyphen.

Now, we've stored the result as `x`, and R will remember that `x` is 6. You can see in the environment pane in R Studio (top right) that there's now a "value" called `x` and it's 6. You can also access the value of `x` by typing `x` into R. Check it out:
```{r x}
x
```

**NOTE:** R is "case-sensitive", which means that upper-case letters are *different than* lower-case letters. Notice what happens when we ask R for the value of `X`:

```{r X, error = T}
X
```

When giving things names in R, you can only use a combination of letters, numbers, periods, and underscores, and the names have to start with a letter or a period. People tend to use underscores or periods instead of spaces.

Watch what happens when you try to assign something to a "bad" name:
```{r badName1, error = T}
tik tok <- 12
```

```{r badName2, error = T}
4eva <- 4 * 2 
```

```{r badName3, error = T}
_hi_mom <- 5^2
```

The errors saying "unexpected symbols" or "unexpected input" are R's way of telling you that these names are not allowed, and that you should use a different name. Here's how we'd correct these:
```{r goodNames}
tiktok <- 12
forever <- 4 * 2
dear_mother <- 5^2
```

## CSV files: a common way to store data

CSV stands for "comma separated values" and is a commonly used file type for storing data. 
Open the file "penguins.csv" from the files pane (lower right) to see what a .csv file looks like:

![](assets/images/csv-demo.jpg)

Each row of the file is an "observation" or "case", and consists of one or more variables whose *values* are *separated* by *commas* (hey, look at that). The first row contains the names of the variables contained in the file.

### Palmer Penguins Data
We're going to start by working with a data set with data on 333 penguins collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipeligo in Antarctica. Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php)
and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), and the data were prepared by [Dr. Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins).

![Artwork by @allison_horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png)

We can **read** data into R using a function called `read.csv()`. The first argument to `read.csv()` is the name of a .csv file (here, `penguins.csv`), in quotes. We then store the results of `read.csv()` as an object called `penguins`.

```{r readData}
penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Let's see what's in the data. We can peek at the first few (6, specifically) rows of the data using the `head()` function:
```{r headPenguins}
head(penguins)
```
We read that line as "*head* of *penguins*". Remember that `penguins` is what we named our data set. We can see that `penguins` contains a number of *variables*, like `species`, `island`, and more. 

| Variable name | Description |
|:--------------|:------------|
|`species`| Penguin species (Ad&eacute;lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) |
|`island`| Island in Palmer Archipeligo, Antarctica, on which the penguin was observed (Biscoe, Dream, or Torgersen) |
|`bill_length_mm`| A number denoting bill length (in millimeters) |
|`bill_depth_mm`| A number denoting bill depth (in millimeters) |
|`flipper_length_mm`| A whole number denoting flipper length (in millimeters) |
|`body_mass_g`| A whole number denoting penguin body mass (in grams) |
|`sex`| Penguin sex (female, male) |
|`year`| Study year (2007, 2008, 2009) |
